# NimAI
This repository contains an implementation of an Artificial Intelligence agent for the Nim game, built using the Alpha-Beta Pruning search algorithm. The goal of this project is to demonstrate how a competitive search strategy can be applied to a classic logic game to create fast, efficient, and optimal decision-making.
